# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use on my Macbook Pro.

## Vim

My vim configuration requires [Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim). To edit the .vimrc, just use the alias (found in .zsh_profile) that will automatically reload the configuration and install plugins. To use the fuzzy file finder, follow the instructions to install [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
